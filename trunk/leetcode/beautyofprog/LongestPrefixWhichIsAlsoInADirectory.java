	/**
	 * Trie over BST
	 * - looking up for keys are fast, O(length of key), for BST, it is log(n)
	 * - more space-efficient if it contains lots of short keys
	 * - balance
	 * 
	 * hashtable
	 * - trie supports ordered iteration
	 * - tire can have prefix matching
	 * - faster in average insertion (for hashcode, it needs rehashing, etc)
	 * - no hash function is needed
