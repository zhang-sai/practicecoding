/**
 * 
 * Write a function to validate a complete binary tree. That is, the function 
will take a binary tree as an input argument and return true if the given 
binary tree is a complete binary tree.

A binary tree is complete if all levels except possibly the last are 
completely full, and the last level has all its node to the left side.

For example, the following is a complete binary tree:


       a

     /  \

    b     c

   /    

  d    

The followings are not complete binary trees:


      a

    /   \

   b     c

        / \

       d  e


      a

    /   \

   b     c

  /     / \

f     d    e
