 * Three coke machines: big, medium, and small, each of which can produce
 * coke by [min_big, max_big], [min_medium, max_medium], and [min_small, max_small]
 * 
 * So, decide whether it is possible to get coke between [D, E], in other words,
 * you need to find x, y, and z that: x*Amin+y*Bmin+z*Cmin>=D and x*Amax+y*Bmax+z*Cmax<=E
