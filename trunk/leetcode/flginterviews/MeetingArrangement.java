/**
 * Given a vector of Nodes, each of which contain the start and end time of a 
meeting, find the maximum number of rooms one would have to book for the day
. 
seems is the max overlap: 1) sort based on start time 2) scan meeting one by
one, insert new meeting, and then scan the meetings in linked list, if they
stil valid for the new start time, then max++, otherwise clear them out
time should be O(n^2)
