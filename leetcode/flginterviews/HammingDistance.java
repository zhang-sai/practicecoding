/**
 * a) first, write a function to calculate the hamming distance between two 
binary numbers
(b) write a function that takes a list of binary numbers and returns the sum
of the hamming distances for each pair
O(n) solution is recore each position how many 1 and how many 0, and 
multiply them for each position and add together
