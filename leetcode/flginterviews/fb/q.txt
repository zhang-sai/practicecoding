 - the celebrity
 There can be at most one celebrity. Suppose A and B are both celebrities. A knows B by virtue of B's celebrity. But then A can't be a celebrity, by virtue of the rule that celebrities can't know anyone. Given that you have only celebrity, you can use a linear algorithm. Start with person 1, and they're the provisional celebrity. With person 2, see if either 2 doesn't know 1 or 1 knows 2, and if so, 1 is no longer a celebrity, and swap 1 and 2. For each new person, try to see if you can eliminate the celebrity's status with two simple checks, and then swap as needed. 

After the first linear pass, you'll have a provisional celebrity, and then take another linear pass to verify that he really is a celebrity. 

If there are no celebrities, then the second pass will be terminate fairly quickly.
